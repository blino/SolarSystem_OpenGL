# Solar system simulation using OpenGL

This is a personal project to learn OpenGL.  
Given eccentricity, the trajectory for each planet is calculated from the Kepler's Equatation. Newton's method is used to get numerical positions. The distances and scale for all celestial objects are disorted, while their revolution and rotation periods are proportional to the Earth's rotation period.

This project is still ongoing.  
The Moon and the Shadow mapping will be included.
